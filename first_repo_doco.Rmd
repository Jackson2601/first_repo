This report documents me learning how to use Github. So far, i have staged and committed changes and pulled changed files from my online Git, and pushed changes from my local repo to the online Git. 

Lets create a test plot of distance (miles) and speed (mph)

```{r, test-plot, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars, col = "red", xlab = "Speed (mph)", ylab = "Distance (miles)")
```

A summary of the data frame is given below

```{r, cars-summary, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
kable(summary(cars))
```
